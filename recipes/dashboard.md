## Recommended Pattern Stack

- [page-grid](../patterns/grid-repetition/page-grid.md)
- [card-grid](../patterns/grid-repetition/card-grid.md)
- [cluster](../patterns/in-line-grouping/cluster.md)

## DOM And Source Order

Order panels by decision priority, not by visual symmetry. Headings and filters should precede the regions they control.

## Scroll Ownership

Prefer normal document scrolling. Introduce internal scroll containers only for panels whose independent scroll state is part of the task.

## Accessibility Checklist

- Source order: Order panels by the decision path a reader should follow; do not let grid placement make lower-priority panels read first.
- Focus expectation: Filters, chart controls, and panel actions must follow the same priority order as their controlled regions.
- Scroll expectation: If a panel scrolls internally, name the panel, keep its heading outside or at the start of that scroll region, and verify focus is not trapped inside it.
- Semantic risk: Repeated metric cards can become anonymous groups; use headings, table/list semantics, or labelled regions before applying grid classes.
- Cognitive risk: Dense dashboards increase comparison load; group metrics by task and avoid relying on position or color alone to explain status.
- Verification method: Combine `automated` landmark/heading/contrast checks with `manual` keyboard, source-order, and cognitive walkthrough evidence; use `user` evidence for task-completion claims.

## Responsive Behavior

Let repeated panels reflow through grid constraints before adding viewport breakpoints. Action clusters should wrap before they overflow.

## Constraints And Change Points

Make page gutters, panel gaps, and minimum panel widths explicit. Avoid hiding a panel's overflow unless the panel has a declared fixed block size.

## When Not To Use

Do not use this recipe for a single focused workflow. A [form flow](form-flow.md) or [content-limiter](../patterns/containment/content-limiter.md) is usually clearer.
