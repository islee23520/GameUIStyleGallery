# Layout Planning Guide

Primary role: planning workflow.

Use this guide before a layout problem appears. It helps you classify a screen, name its spatial responsibilities, and choose a small stack of layout patterns before writing application CSS.

`layout-gallery` has two modes:

- **After a problem appears:** find a named pattern in `CATALOG.md` and port its HTML/CSS contract.
- **Before a problem appears:** start with the screen type, answer the layout brief, then compose patterns from `recipes/`.
- **When content needs to become a webpage:** use the [Webpage generation workflow](guides/webpage-generation-workflow.md) to classify the use case, make the content-to-layout match, run harmony evaluation, create the GPT Image reference, and record the implementation handoff before writing product CSS.

## Planning Flow

1. Identify the primary user task.
2. Name the primary content and supporting content.
3. If the request is an ordinary webpage or homepage, classify the use case before choosing a recipe.
4. Decide what owns scrolling.
5. Decide whether the problem is viewport-level or component-local.
6. Choose a screen recipe.
7. Replace any recipe pattern that does not match the real content constraints.
8. Run a harmony evaluation against the chosen use case, content hierarchy, pattern stack, and accessibility constraints.
9. If visual direction is needed, create a GPT Image reference from the approved layout brief and keep the image outside reusable pattern CSS.
10. Record an implementation handoff: pattern stack, semantic order, constraints, image-reference observations, accepted debt, and verification plan.
11. Verify the result against long, empty, narrow, and wide content.

## Entry Points

- [Decision tree](guides/decision-tree.md): start here when you do not know the pattern name.
- [Layout brief](guides/layout-brief.md): answer these questions before selecting a pattern stack.
- [Webpage generation workflow](guides/webpage-generation-workflow.md): start here when content needs to become a homepage or ordinary webpage.
- [Documentation mode taxonomy](guides/documentation-mode-taxonomy.md): use this when adding, moving, or reviewing documentation.
- [Controlled vocabulary](guides/vocabulary.md): use this when terms affect routing, metadata, search, claim records, or review decisions.
- [Recipe index](recipes/index.md): screen-type compositions built from reusable patterns.
- [Pattern catalog](CATALOG.md): individual layout primitives and their contracts.

## How To Choose A Recipe

Choose the recipe that matches the screen's spatial model, not the product category.

- A settings page and documentation app may both use a fixed side navigation.
- A dashboard and gallery may both use repeated grid regions.
- A support inbox and file browser may both use list-detail layout.
- A command surface and toolbar-heavy editor may both need wrapping or scrolling action rows.
- A landing page, product homepage, personal site, and campaign page may all start from the [Homepage](recipes/homepage.md) recipe, then diverge by section jobs and visual direction.

Recipes are starting points. If a recipe has one pattern that does not fit, replace that pattern rather than copying the recipe blindly.

## What Not To Put Here

The planning layer does not define brand, typography, color, border, shadow, or animation. Those belong to the consuming product. This repository only records layout responsibility, semantic structure, constraints, scroll ownership, and composition.
