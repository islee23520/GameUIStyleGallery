StyleGallery is a governed gallery of portable interface knowledge. It separates reusable spatial patterns, product-layer motion guidance, design-engineering practice, platform-specific references, and comparative design terminology into explicit domains with different evidence and ownership boundaries.

Primary role: repository guide.

The existing Layout corpus remains a gallery of minimal, portable CSS layout patterns at its current paths. Each pattern documents one primary spatial problem and the smallest robust HTML/CSS structure that solves it. Motion, visual treatment, and platform guidance do not expand reusable Layout pattern CSS; they live in their own domains and carry explicit evidence boundaries.

[Consumer Reference](consumer-reference/index.md) is shared non-domain infrastructure for optional consumer-owned reference handoffs. It carries schema, routing, provenance, and evidence metadata without owning profiles, visual values, components, or an eighth domain.

[Agent-Native StyleGallery](consumer-reference/agent-native/README.md) documents the frozen v1 claim/evidence/governance interface. The `sg` CLI and main MCP server also expose [website compilation](scripts/compiler/README.md) through a separately installed compiler; isolated material v2 indexes admitted Markdown through `sg-material` and its read-only MCP. Lifecycle records own extension and archive dispositions. These interfaces do not create a seventh domain, replace the Markdown corpus, permit mutation of governed knowledge, or feed visual defaults back into Layout.

## Quick Start

StyleGallery requires Node.js 22 or newer. Run a command without installing anything globally:

```sh
npx stylegallery discover --format json
```

Or install the CLI globally:

```sh
npm install --global stylegallery
sg discover --format json
```

The npm package includes the pinned `@chenglou/pretext@0.0.8` browser text-layout engine. StyleGallery uses it as a measurement and verification dependency for text-fit QA; the Node CLI and MCP servers do not execute browser Canvas APIs.

Common read-only commands:

```sh
sg resolve sg:profile/editorial-reference-profile --format json
sg claims sg:profile/editorial-reference-profile --format json
sg context sg:profile/editorial-reference-profile --format json
sg ops --format json
```

Every command writes JSON to stdout. Knowledge results retain their deterministic v1 payloads; `discover` and `ops` also report the local compiler installation. Invalid input returns an error object and a nonzero exit status. See [Agent-Native StyleGallery](consumer-reference/agent-native/README.md) for the frozen knowledge contract, StableRef and VersionID model, MCP resources, and trust boundaries.

Compile a website directly through SG after [installing the compiler](scripts/compiler/README.md#setup):

```sh
export SG_COMPILER_ROOT=/absolute/path/to/site-compiler
sg compile --url https://example.com --out ./captures/example
sg timeline --url https://example.com --out ./captures/example --step 500
sg workflow
```

`compile`, `timeline`, `transcribe`, `sale`, `gate`, and `build` are direct SG commands and MCP tool names. See [SG Website Compilation](scripts/compiler/README.md) for all commands, configuration, output ownership, and verification.

Start with `sg workflow` to select the stages for reconstruction, adaptation, or sale-package production. For a faithful clone, use available original media and fill document gaps by inspecting the source. The automatic `build` command is a sale-edition preview with restricted source access; it is not the general clone builder.

Material v2 searches the admitted Markdown corpus and returns JSON without an additional format flag:

```sh
npx --package stylegallery sg-material discover
npx --package stylegallery sg-material search --query "sticky layout" --paths-only --limit 5
npx --package stylegallery sg-material context --query "responsive sidebar" --budget-tokens 4096
```

With a global install, the same commands are available as `sg-material discover`, `sg-material search`, and `sg-material context`.

For a coding agent with repository filesystem access, local guided traversal is the default: read `AGENTS.md` and this README, follow the narrowest relevant task route or domain index, and inspect the selected Markdown files directly. Use `search --paths-only` only when the path is unclear; it returns a deterministic `paths` array of repository-relative candidates without full result metadata. Reserve `context` for environments that cannot read repository files or for transferring a bounded, provenance-linked package.

### Worked homepage example

The [StyleGallery homepage example](examples/stylegallery-homepage/README.md) was planned from a clean install of the published npm package. It demonstrates the Homepage recipe, selected layout patterns, agent-native CLI access, responsive behavior, and Chrome CDP verification in a standalone product-layer implementation.

The [Toss-inspired homepage clone](examples/toss-homepage-clone/README.md) applies the same workflow to an observed external homepage: it maps the source into section jobs, composes existing Layout patterns, keeps brand styling in the example layer, and records desktop, mobile, keyboard, overflow, and reduced-motion checks.

The [Scroll Story Lab](examples/scroll-story/README.md) adds runnable scroll-controlled product chapters, an image sequence with bounded decoding, native CSS scrubbing, and a static reading path. Start from [Motion’s scroll-driven story](motion/interaction-recipes.md#scroll-driven-story) for ownership and failure cases. The [Scene Navigation example](examples/scene-navigation/README.md) keeps the entire page fixed while wheel, keys, chapter links, and art-surface swipes select scenes; its [separate contract](motion/interaction-recipes.md#full-viewport-scene-navigation) covers input ownership, history, focus, and reading escape.

### MCP server

Launch the packaged stdio server with:

```sh
npx --package stylegallery stylegallery-mcp
```

Example MCP client configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "stylegallery": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["--yes", "--package", "stylegallery", "stylegallery-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

The main MCP server exposes governed read operations and compiler execution tools. Configure `SG_COMPILER_ROOT` in its environment to use the compiler. Execution tools declare file and network effects; the knowledge registry remains a read-only API. The frozen read-only server remains available as `bun run sg:mcp:v1`.

The separate Material v2 MCP server is available as `stylegallery-material-mcp`. Attach it for Markdown retrieval and authoring work; the main server covers governed knowledge reads and compiler execution.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "stylegallery-material": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["--yes", "--package", "stylegallery", "stylegallery-material-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

## 한국어 빠른 시작

StyleGallery는 Node.js 22 이상에서 실행됩니다. 전역 설치 없이 바로 사용하려면 다음 명령을 실행하세요.

```sh
npx stylegallery discover --format json
```

자주 사용한다면 전역으로 설치할 수 있습니다.

```sh
npm install --global stylegallery
sg discover --format json
```

`discover`는 사용 가능한 인터페이스를 보여주고, `resolve`는 하나의 레코드를 조회하며, `claims`는 관련 주장과 근거를 분리해서 보여줍니다. `context`는 에이전트에 전달할 수 있는 제한된 컨텍스트 패키지를 만들고, `ops`는 지원하는 작업 목록을 반환합니다. 저장소를 직접 읽을 수 있는 에이전트는 `AGENTS.md`와 이 README의 작업 경로에서 시작해 로컬 Markdown을 따라가는 방식이 기본입니다. 경로가 불명확할 때만 `sg-material search --query "검색어" --paths-only --limit 5`로 후보 경로를 좁히고, `context`는 파일에 직접 접근할 수 없거나 제한된 패키지를 전달해야 할 때 사용합니다. 모든 결과는 자동화에 바로 사용할 수 있는 JSON입니다.

## Link Policy

- Navigation links move a reader to the next decision point in the repository. Root hubs, indexes, parent links, and next-step links are navigation links.
- Citation links identify source lineage or evidence boundaries. They support a claim but should not be the only way to continue a task.
- Dependency links identify generated, validation, or composition relationships. They explain what must stay in sync, such as `scripts/pattern-data.mjs`, generated pattern files, catalog entries, and validator fixtures.

## How To Use This Repository

- Start with [StyleGallery Domains](DOMAINS.md) when the owning domain is not already clear.
- Use [Layout](layout/index.md), [Motion](motion/index.md), [Design Engineering](design-engineering/index.md), [Game UI](game-ui/index.md), [Platform Guides](platform-guides/index.md), [Design Terminology](design-terminology/index.md), or [Expression](expression/index.md) as the domain-local entry point.
- Start with [Layout Planning Guide](GUIDE.md) when you are designing a screen before a layout problem is obvious.
- Use the [Webpage Generation Workflow](guides/webpage-generation-workflow.md) when raw content needs to become a homepage or ordinary webpage before a layout recipe is obvious.
- Use the [Documentation Mode Taxonomy](guides/documentation-mode-taxonomy.md) when adding or reviewing docs so each page has a clear primary reading mode.
- Use the [Controlled vocabulary](guides/vocabulary.md) when a term affects routing, metadata, search, claim records, workflow handoff, or review decisions.
- Use the [Decision Tree](guides/decision-tree.md) when you do not know the pattern name yet.
- Fill out the [Layout Brief Template](guides/layout-brief.md) before choosing a pattern stack.
- Use [Layout Recipes](recipes/index.md) when you need screen-level composition.
- Use [Layout Pattern Catalog](CATALOG.md) when you already know the spatial problem.
- Use [Quality Gates](quality/index.md) when a claim needs principle-backed evidence, visual QA boundaries, accessibility precedence, or design rationale.
- Use [Consumer Reference](consumer-reference/index.md) when an implementation handoff must declare one repository-local JSON reference or a sentence explaining non-applicability.
- Use [Agent-Native StyleGallery](consumer-reference/agent-native/README.md) when a person, script, or agent needs deterministic JSON discovery, StableRef/VersionID resolution, bounded context, operation metadata, or read-only MCP access.
- Use [Consumer Migration Readiness](design-engineering/consumer-migration-readiness.md) only for a migration that declares a consumer-local conformance record; ordinary handoffs keep the existing `not_applicable` path.
- Use [Governance, Lifecycle, And Docs-As-Code](GOVERNANCE.md) before changing generated artifacts, validators, lifecycle state, or ownership policy.

## Layout Domain Principles

Layout patterns solve one primary spatial problem with semantic structure, robust plain HTML/CSS, explicit constraints, named scroll ownership, and no decorative debt. The detailed principles live in the [Layout domain contract](layout/index.md#layout-domain-principles).

## CSS Authoring Policy

Reusable Layout CSS favors low specificity, intrinsic sizing, logical properties, and responsiveness at the correct container or viewport boundary. See the [detailed CSS authoring policy](layout/index.md#css-authoring-policy).

## Class Naming Policy

Layout class names describe stable spatial responsibilities and relationships rather than appearance or DOM depth. See the [detailed class naming policy](layout/index.md#class-naming-policy).

## Value And Token Policy

Tokens represent stable shared design intent; browser and context mechanics remain explicit CSS values. See the [detailed value and token policy](layout/index.md#value-and-token-policy).

## Pattern Contract

Every pattern documents its primary problem, structure, constraints, scroll ownership, accessibility, fallbacks, composition, and failure boundaries. See the [detailed pattern contract](layout/index.md#pattern-contract), and use the generated [Pattern Categories](patterns/index.md) as the category inventory.

## Verification Matrix

Pattern verification covers the relevant viewport, container, content, direction, writing-mode, interaction, overflow, focus, and sticky/scroll cases. See the [detailed verification matrix](layout/index.md#verification-matrix).
