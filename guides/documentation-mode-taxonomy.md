# Documentation Mode Taxonomy

Use this guide when adding, moving, or reviewing documentation. Each page should have one primary documentation mode so readers know whether to learn, follow steps, look up a contract, understand a rationale, or apply a policy gate.

## Modes

| Mode | Reader posture | Page should contain |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tutorial | Learn by completing a first small task. | Ordered path, concrete starting state, completion marker. |
| How-to | Follow steps to finish a known task. | Action sequence, decision points, expected handoff. |
| Reference | Look up stable facts or contracts. | Names, fields, sections, generated indexes, boundaries. |
| Explanation | Understand principles and rationale. | Why the repo works this way, scope, tradeoffs. |
| Policy/procedure | Decide whether work is admissible. | Required contract, evidence, blocking conditions, boundary. |

Do not use `mixed` as a mode. If a page has more than one reading posture, keep one primary mode and record the secondary mode plus the reason.

## Hybrid Decisions

| Page or family | Decision | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `README.md` | Keep and label | The page primarily explains repository purpose, but it must also route readers to the correct next document. |
| `GUIDE.md` | Keep and label | The page is a how-to entry point, but it needs explanation to separate before-problem and after-problem use. |
| `DOMAINS.md` | Keep and label | The manifest is a domain reference whose scope, lifecycle, and provenance rules also govern edits. |
| `GOVERNANCE.md` | Keep and label | The page is a governance reference whose rules also operate as edit procedure. |
| `AGENTS.md` | Keep as policy/procedure | The page governs agent edits and doubles as a reference for recurring repository rules. |
| `guides/decision-tree.md` | Keep and label | The page is navigational how-to; reference links are necessary outputs, not a competing mode. |
| `guides/layout-brief.md` | Keep and label | The page is a fill-in how-to whose prompts also act as a stable brief reference. |
| `guides/vocabulary.md` | Keep and label | The page is a term reference with policy rules for canonical and deprecated language. |
| `guides/webpage-generation-workflow.md` | Keep and label | The page is a how-to workflow with policy checkpoints around harmony, image reference, and handoff order. |
| `guides/documentation-mode-taxonomy.md` | Keep and label | The page is a reference matrix with policy rules for avoiding unlabeled mixed modes. |
| `recipes/index.md` | Keep and label | The page is a recipe lookup index, with enough how-to routing to choose the next recipe. |
| `recipes/primitive-to-recipe-matrix.md` | Keep and label | The page is a reference matrix that supports how-to substitution decisions. |
| `recipes/*.md` | Intentional hybrid | Recipes teach composition steps while preserving reusable reference contracts for pattern stacks, constraints, and scroll ownership. |
| `quality/index.md` | Keep and label | The page explains why the quality layer exists and routes readers into policy/procedure gates. |
| `quality/principles.md` | Keep and label | The page explains shared principles that later become gate policy. |
| `quality/claims.md` | Keep and label | The page is a claim-record reference with procedure for when a record is required. |
| `quality/claim-records/samples.md` | Keep and label | The page is a reference example set that explains why each claim shape is acceptable. |
| `quality/gates/index.md` | Keep and label | The page is a gate lookup index, with policy/procedure routing to the correct contract. |
| `quality/gates/*.md` | Keep as policy/procedure | Gate pages must remain checkable procedures with required contracts, evidence families, blocking conditions, and boundaries. |
| `quality/evidence/*.md` | Keep as reference | Evidence pages define what a source or artifact can support; they do not decide pass/fail by themselves. |

## Task Routing

| User task | Read first | Then read |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Understand what the repository is for. | `README.md` | `DOMAINS.md` |
| Choose the owning StyleGallery domain. | `DOMAINS.md` | The selected domain `index.md` |
| Name or review product motion. | `motion/index.md` | The matching Motion reference or workflow |
| Review a product-level craft decision. | `design-engineering/index.md` | `design-engineering/interface-craft.md`, then the relevant quality gate |
| Compare an Apple interaction convention. | `platform-guides/index.md` | `platform-guides/apple-interaction.md` and current official sources |
| Choose a layout when the pattern name is unknown. | `GUIDE.md` | `guides/decision-tree.md` |
| Turn raw content into a homepage or webpage. | `guides/webpage-generation-workflow.md` | `recipes/homepage.md`, `quality/gates/harmony-evaluation.md` |
| Look up a known layout primitive. | `CATALOG.md` | The relevant `patterns/*/*.md` page |
| Compose a screen from reusable patterns. | `recipes/index.md` | The matching recipe page and linked pattern contracts |
| Review whether a quality claim is admissible. | `quality/index.md` | The relevant `quality/gates/*.md` and `quality/evidence/*.md` pages |
| Edit repository docs or patterns as an agent. | `AGENTS.md` | This taxonomy and the changed page family |

## First-Run Tutorial Outline

The webpage-generation path needs a tutorial only when a reader has raw content and has not yet produced a layout handoff before. Keep the full workflow in `guides/webpage-generation-workflow.md`; add a separate tutorial only if repeated users need a smaller first success path.

Suggested tutorial outline:

1. Start with one short homepage brief and supplied content blocks.
2. Name the use case and primary task.
3. Map content blocks to section jobs.
4. Choose `recipes/homepage.md` or reject it with one reason.
5. Run the harmony gate checklist.
6. Produce the implementation handoff.

Completion marker:

```txt
First-run complete when the reader has a use case, section-job map, selected recipe, harmony-gate decision, and implementation handoff.
```

Do not treat generated imagery, screenshots, or decorative choices as the tutorial completion marker. The first success is a handoff that can be implemented without weakening semantic order, scroll ownership, or quality-gate boundaries.
