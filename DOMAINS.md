# StyleGallery Domains

Primary role: domain manifest.

This manifest is the source of truth for top-level StyleGallery domains. A domain owns a coherent decision surface; a category is a domain-local browse placement and must not be used as a synonym for domain.

## Domain Contract

| Domain | Hub | Lifecycle | Owns | Does not own | Review owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Layout | [Layout](layout/index.md) | `stable` and `generated` | Spatial patterns, recipes, planning, constraints, and scroll ownership. | Product motion, visual treatment, or platform imitation. | Pattern-data owner |
| Motion | [Motion](motion/index.md) | `experimental` | Motion naming, review procedure, and bounded practice guidance. | Universal prescriptions or reusable Layout CSS. | Motion domain owner |
| Design Engineering | [Design Engineering](design-engineering/index.md) | `experimental` | Product-layer craft questions and evidence-bearing decisions. | A second shared principle system or taste as proof. | Design Engineering domain owner |
| Game UI | [Game UI](game-ui/index.md) | `experimental` | Game-interface classification, hierarchy, reference records, and implementation guides nested by engine. | Reusable Layout CSS or claims that one engine structure is universal. | Game UI domain owner |
| Platform Guides | [Platform Guides](platform-guides/index.md) | `experimental` | Comparative references for a named platform and version context. | Affiliation, brand imitation, or authority over web standards. | Platform Guides domain owner |
| Design Terminology | [Design Terminology](design-terminology/index.md) | `experimental` | Source-kind classification, concept-family classification, typed term relations, and cross-system conflict cases for named vocabulary sources. | StyleGallery's own controlled vocabulary, motion terminology, visual token values, universal naming prescriptions, or authority over external vocabularies. | Design Terminology domain owner |
| Expression | [Expression](expression/index.md) | `experimental` | Art-direction briefs, named directions with starting values, visual technique recipes, and the unofficial brand-study policy for product pages. | Layout mechanics, motion timing and review, governed tokens or reference profiles, and any decorative value in reusable Layout pattern CSS. | Expression domain owner |

## Page Manifest

| Domain | Manual hub | Governed leaves |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Layout | `layout/index.md` | Existing `GUIDE.md`, Layout-specific `guides/*.md`, and `recipes/*.md`; generated `patterns/**/*.md` and `CATALOG.md` remain at current paths. Shared `quality/**/*.md` infrastructure governs every domain without becoming a Layout leaf. |

## Shared Non-Domain Infrastructure

[Consumer Reference](consumer-reference/index.md) is shared schema, provenance, routing, evidence, lifecycle, and machine-retrieval infrastructure outside the seven-domain contract. Its source-bound material v2 index classifies admitted pages by these seven domains but does not own their prose. It owns no profile implementation, visual values, or product CSS and cannot add an eighth domain row. Consumer or profile records may depend on Layout; Layout and its generated corpus cannot import consumer-reference, profile, material-registry, or transport records.

## Showcase Work Area

[Showcase](showcase/README.md) holds finished, expressive product pages. It is not a domain and owns no governed guidance. Its works depend on Layout, Expression, and Motion; no domain depends on them. Layout authoring rules do not apply to showcase CSS. Instead, each work must pass the outcome checks in `scripts/check-showcase.mjs`, defined by the [Showcase QA contract](showcase/QA.md). Values proven in a work re-enter the governed corpus only by being written into an Expression or Motion page.

## External Adaptation Contract

The initial five domain leaves are independent method rewrites inspired by [emilkowalski/skills](https://github.com/emilkowalski/skills) at snapshot `220e8607c90b17337d210125777b7b695f26c221`. Other adapted leaves record their own repositories and revisions in page metadata.

- Each externally adapted leaf records `source_repository`, exact `source_path`, and the full `source_revision`. Locally authored synthesis leaves state that boundary in their attribution section and omit upstream metadata.
- A full SHA identifies source content; it does not prove publisher authenticity or local quality.
- The local pages do not retain upstream prose, tables, code samples, distinctive examples, or distinctive sequence.
- Apple/WWDC-derived expression and quotations attributed to other authors, including the Paul Graham quotation noted during review, are excluded.
- If recognizable upstream expression is added later, preserve the full upstream MIT notice and record the copied material separately before merge.
- Tracked repository documents must not depend on `.omo/`; stable upstream blob links and tracked repository contracts carry contributor-facing provenance.

The workflow, brief, contract, recipe, and comparison leaves added under the five non-Layout domains are StyleGallery-local synthesis with `provenance_kind: local`; their worked scenarios are proposals, not captured product evidence. The domain indexes route selection, authoring, application, and verification.

`design-engineering/consumer-migration-readiness.md` is a separately declared StyleGallery-local leaf. It uses `provenance_kind: local`, carries no external source fields, and remains experimental. Its presence does not change the external-adaptation inventory or make its consumer-local method universal policy.

## Lifecycle And Staleness

External adaptations begin `experimental`. Domain lifecycle changes are repository-owner decisions based on whether the bounded scope remains coherent, provenance and platform-version obligations are current, and machine-checkable contracts have relevant validator coverage. User studies, reader tasks, adoption counts, and attestations are neither required nor sufficient for a domain lifecycle change. Remove or revise a page when its source revision changes materially, a platform claim becomes stale, a local quality gate contradicts it, or its route or boundary no longer matches the domain contract.

### Consumer Reference Promotion

This separate contract governs consumer-reference invariant sharing only; it does not govern domain or page lifecycle. Consumer-reference promotion does not add a domain. The [canonical promotion contract](consumer-reference/contract.md#promotion-boundary) owns the full human-readable boundary, and the [canonical JSON promotion policy](consumer-reference/policies/shared-experimental.json) owns machine policy. As a boundary summary: the `>=2` gateway applies only to consumer-local → shared-experimental invariant eligibility; Editorial and terminal are related examples in one fixture set; Shared stable has no numeric adoption threshold; and Normative correctness may waive adoption count only. A failed stable contract is never silently relabeled experimental. Promotion records are JSON-only, and the committed examples remain synthetic with zero adopter attestations.
