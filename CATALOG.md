## Planning Layer

- [Layout Planning Guide](GUIDE.md) - Pre-design entry point for choosing and composing patterns.
- [Decision Tree](guides/decision-tree.md) - Question-driven route from screen constraints to pattern categories.
- [Layout Brief](guides/layout-brief.md) - Questions to answer before selecting a pattern stack.
- [Layout Recipes](recipes/index.md) - Screen-level compositions built from reusable patterns.

## Patterns

- [stack](patterns/stacking/stack.md) - Stacking: Create consistent vertical rhythm between direct children.
- [box](patterns/containment/box.md) - Containment: Wrap content with predictable internal spacing.
- [center](patterns/centering/center.md) - Centering: Center a block while respecting a maximum measure.
- [cluster](patterns/in-line-grouping/cluster.md) - In-line grouping: Keep related items together while allowing wrapping.
- [content-limiter](patterns/containment/content-limiter.md) - Containment: Keep prose width readable inside fluid containers.
- [super-center](patterns/centering/super-center.md) - Centering: Center one region along both axes.
- [icon-frame](patterns/media-fit/icon-frame.md) - Media / Fit: Keep an icon aligned inside a fixed square slot.
- [frame](patterns/media-fit/frame.md) - Media / Fit: Preserve media aspect ratio in a responsive slot.
- [cover](patterns/viewport-shell/cover.md) - Viewport / Shell: Keep a central region balanced between optional header and footer.
- [sidebar](patterns/split-sidebar/sidebar.md) - Split / Sidebar: Let a narrow sidebar and wider content wrap when space is tight.
