# page-grid

## When To Use

Use this pattern when you need to align page content to margins, gutters, and a central track.

## HTML

```html
<section class="page_grid" aria-label="Article page">
    <main class="page_grid_content">Centered article track with fluid outer gutters</main>
</section>
```

## CSS

```css
.page_grid {
    display: grid;
    gap: 1rem;
    grid-template-columns: minmax(1rem, 1fr) minmax(0, 72rem) minmax(1rem, 1fr);
}

.page_grid_content {
    grid-column: 2;
}
```

## Core Properties

- `display`, `gap`, `grid-template-columns`, `grid-column` define the spatial behavior for this pattern.

## Properties That Break The Layout If Removed

- Removing `display`, `gap`, `grid-template-columns`, `grid-column` changes the pattern from its documented layout responsibility back toward ordinary flow or an unsafe fixed arrangement.

## Constraints And Change Points

- fluid responsiveness is part of the contract; change sizing values only when the new minimum, maximum, or wrap point is documented with the pattern.
- Keep the HTML class hooks and CSS selectors in one-to-one agreement.

## Scroll Ownership

No internal scroll container.

## Accessibility And Source Order Notes

- Semantic role expectation: Preserve the HTML sample's landmark, list, navigation, form, figure, or article roles; layout classes must not replace semantic elements.
- DOM order expectation: Keep semantic elements, DOM order, reading order, and focus order independent from the visual placement created by the layout classes.
- Focus risk: Any interactive descendants follow DOM order; do not use this pattern to create a visual order that keyboard focus cannot follow.
- Scroll expectation: No internal scroll container.
- Cognitive risk: Low: the pattern should preserve ordinary reading flow when semantic order is already correct.

## Browser And Fallback Notes

The CSS uses modern grid, flex, intrinsic sizing, logical properties, or positioning. If a target browser cannot support a property, fall back to ordinary block flow before adding decorative or script-driven layout behavior.

## Composition Notes

Use `page_grid` as the stable pattern root and compose additional layout behavior outside that root unless the child class is part of the documented relationship.

## Anti-patterns

- Do not add color, border, shadow, typography, or animation rules to reusable pattern CSS.
- Do not use this pattern to repair unclear HTML structure; make the DOM roles legible first.
