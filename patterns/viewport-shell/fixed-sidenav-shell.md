# fixed-sidenav-shell

## When To Use

Use this pattern when you need to keep side navigation stable while main content scrolls.

## HTML

```html
<section class="fixed_sidenav_shell" aria-label="Settings">
    <nav class="fixed_sidenav_shell_list"><a href="#">Profile</a><a href="#">Billing</a></nav>
    <main class="fixed_sidenav_shell_main">Editable settings form scrolls independently</main>
</section>
```

## CSS

```css
.fixed_sidenav_shell {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 16rem minmax(0, 1fr);
    grid-template-rows: minmax(0, 1fr);
    max-block-size: 100dvh;
}

.fixed_sidenav_shell_list {
    min-block-size: 0;
}

.fixed_sidenav_shell_main {
    min-block-size: 0;
    overflow: auto;
}
```

## Core Properties

- `display`, `grid-template-columns`, `grid-template-rows`, `max-block-size`, `min-block-size`, `overflow` define the spatial behavior for this pattern.

## Properties That Break The Layout If Removed

- Removing `display`, `grid-template-columns`, `grid-template-rows`, `max-block-size`, `min-block-size`, `overflow` changes the pattern from its documented layout responsibility back toward ordinary flow or an unsafe fixed arrangement.

## Constraints And Change Points

- fluid responsiveness is part of the contract; change sizing values only when the new minimum, maximum, or wrap point is documented with the pattern.
- Keep the HTML class hooks and CSS selectors in one-to-one agreement.

## Scroll Ownership

Pattern owns the named scroll container.

## Accessibility And Source Order Notes

Keep semantic elements, DOM order, reading order, and focus order independent from the visual placement created by the layout classes.

## Browser And Fallback Notes

The CSS uses modern grid, flex, intrinsic sizing, logical properties, or positioning. If a target browser cannot support a property, fall back to ordinary block flow before adding decorative or script-driven layout behavior.

## Composition Notes

Use `fixed_sidenav_shell` as the stable pattern root and compose additional layout behavior outside that root unless the child class is part of the documented relationship.

## Anti-patterns

- Do not add color, border, shadow, typography, or animation rules to reusable pattern CSS.
- Do not use this pattern to repair unclear HTML structure; make the DOM roles legible first.
