# scroll-body-shell

## When To Use

Use this pattern when you need to keep shell regions fixed while only the body scrolls.

## HTML

```html
<section class="scroll_body_shell" aria-label="Inbox">
    <header>Inbox filters</header>
    <main class="scroll_body_shell_body">Message list owns vertical scrolling</main>
    <footer>Selected message actions</footer>
</section>
```

## CSS

```css
.scroll_body_shell {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-rows: auto minmax(0, 1fr) auto;
    max-block-size: 100dvh;
}

.scroll_body_shell_body {
    min-block-size: 0;
    overflow: auto;
}
```

## Core Properties

- `display`, `grid-template-rows`, `max-block-size`, `min-block-size`, `overflow` define the spatial behavior for this pattern.

## Properties That Break The Layout If Removed

- Removing `display`, `grid-template-rows`, `max-block-size`, `min-block-size`, `overflow` changes the pattern from its documented layout responsibility back toward ordinary flow or an unsafe fixed arrangement.

## Constraints And Change Points

- fluid responsiveness is part of the contract; change sizing values only when the new minimum, maximum, or wrap point is documented with the pattern.
- Keep the HTML class hooks and CSS selectors in one-to-one agreement.

## Scroll Ownership

Pattern owns the named scroll container.

## Accessibility And Source Order Notes

- Semantic role expectation: Preserve the HTML sample's landmark, list, navigation, form, figure, or article roles; layout classes must not replace semantic elements.
- DOM order expectation: Keep semantic elements, DOM order, reading order, and focus order independent from the visual placement created by the layout classes.
- Focus risk: Any interactive descendants follow DOM order; do not use this pattern to create a visual order that keyboard focus cannot follow.
- Scroll expectation: Pattern owns the named scroll container.
- Cognitive risk: Medium: scroll ownership can hide context, controls, or return points if it is not named in the consuming layout.

## Browser And Fallback Notes

The CSS uses modern grid, flex, intrinsic sizing, logical properties, or positioning. If a target browser cannot support a property, fall back to ordinary block flow before adding decorative or script-driven layout behavior.

## Composition Notes

Use `scroll_body_shell` as the stable pattern root and compose additional layout behavior outside that root unless the child class is part of the documented relationship.

## Anti-patterns

- Do not add color, border, shadow, typography, or animation rules to reusable pattern CSS.
- Do not use this pattern to repair unclear HTML structure; make the DOM roles legible first.
