# reel

## When To Use

Use this pattern when you need to let a row scroll horizontally instead of wrapping.

## HTML

```html
<section class="reel" aria-label="Upcoming events">
    <article>Design critique</article>
    <article>Planning workshop</article>
    <article>Launch review</article>
</section>
```

## CSS

```css
.reel {
    display: grid;
    gap: 1rem;
    grid-auto-columns: minmax(14rem, 35%);
    grid-auto-flow: column;
    overflow-x: auto;
}
```

## Core Properties

- `display`, `gap`, `grid-auto-columns`, `grid-auto-flow`, `overflow-x` define the spatial behavior for this pattern.

## Properties That Break The Layout If Removed

- Removing `display`, `gap`, `grid-auto-columns`, `grid-auto-flow`, `overflow-x` changes the pattern from its documented layout responsibility back toward ordinary flow or an unsafe fixed arrangement.

## Constraints And Change Points

- scroll responsiveness is part of the contract; change sizing values only when the new minimum, maximum, or wrap point is documented with the pattern.
- Keep the HTML class hooks and CSS selectors in one-to-one agreement.

## Scroll Ownership

Pattern owns the named scroll container.

## Accessibility And Source Order Notes

- Semantic role expectation: Preserve the HTML sample's landmark, list, navigation, form, figure, or article roles; layout classes must not replace semantic elements.
- DOM order expectation: Keep semantic elements, DOM order, reading order, and focus order independent from the visual placement created by the layout classes.
- Focus risk: Any interactive descendants follow DOM order; do not use this pattern to create a visual order that keyboard focus cannot follow.
- Scroll expectation: Pattern owns the named scroll container.
- Cognitive risk: Medium: scroll ownership can hide context, controls, or return points if it is not named in the consuming layout.

## Browser And Fallback Notes

The CSS uses modern grid, flex, intrinsic sizing, logical properties, or positioning. If a target browser cannot support a property, fall back to ordinary block flow before adding decorative or script-driven layout behavior.

## Composition Notes

Use `reel` as the stable pattern root and compose additional layout behavior outside that root unless the child class is part of the documented relationship.

## Anti-patterns

- Do not add color, border, shadow, typography, or animation rules to reusable pattern CSS.
- Do not use this pattern to repair unclear HTML structure; make the DOM roles legible first.
