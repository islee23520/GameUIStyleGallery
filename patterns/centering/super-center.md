# super-center

## When To Use

Use this pattern when you need to center one region along both axes.

## HTML

```html
<section class="super_center" aria-labelledby="centered-dialog-title">
    <form aria-labelledby="centered-dialog-title">
        <h2 id="centered-dialog-title">Confirm archive</h2>
        <button>Archive project</button>
    </form>
</section>
```

## CSS

```css
.super_center {
    display: grid;
    min-block-size: 100dvh;
    place-items: center;
}
```

## Core Properties

- `display`, `min-block-size`, `place-items` define the spatial behavior for this pattern.

## Properties That Break The Layout If Removed

- Removing `display`, `min-block-size`, `place-items` changes the pattern from its documented layout responsibility back toward ordinary flow or an unsafe fixed arrangement.

## Constraints And Change Points

- fluid responsiveness is part of the contract; change sizing values only when the new minimum, maximum, or wrap point is documented with the pattern.
- Keep the HTML class hooks and CSS selectors in one-to-one agreement.

## Scroll Ownership

No internal scroll container.

## Accessibility And Source Order Notes

Keep semantic elements, DOM order, reading order, and focus order independent from the visual placement created by the layout classes.

## Browser And Fallback Notes

The CSS uses modern grid, flex, intrinsic sizing, logical properties, or positioning. If a target browser cannot support a property, fall back to ordinary block flow before adding decorative or script-driven layout behavior.

## Composition Notes

Use `super_center` as the stable pattern root and compose additional layout behavior outside that root unless the child class is part of the documented relationship.

## Anti-patterns

- Do not add color, border, shadow, typography, or animation rules to reusable pattern CSS.
- Do not use this pattern to repair unclear HTML structure; make the DOM roles legible first.
