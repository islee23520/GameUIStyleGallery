# Game UI Screen Hierarchy

Primary role: engine-neutral hierarchy guide.

## Repository Boundary

This hierarchy describes interface responsibility, not a required scene graph or prefab tree. Engines may realize the same roles through scenes, widgets, documents, entities, prefabs, or runtime objects.

## Reusable Method

Read a game UI hierarchy from ownership outward:

1. Identify the lifetime owner.
2. Identify the active player task.
3. Separate persistent, replaceable, modal, transient, and world-linked layers.
4. Name screen regions by responsibility.
5. Find repeated components and atomic controls.
6. Record navigation, input blocking, sorting, focus, and teardown ownership.

## Hierarchy Roles

| Level | Owns | Must not silently own |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Application root | Cross-screen lifetime, global routing, top-level sorting | Screen-specific business state |
| Layer host | Ordering, visibility policy, input blocking | Individual component presentation |
| Screen | One primary player task and its navigation boundary | Unrelated global services |
| Region | A stable information or action responsibility | Whole-screen lifecycle |
| Component | Reusable stateful presentation unit | Global navigation policy |
| Control | One direct interaction or value presentation | Hidden cross-screen side effects |

## Composition Rules

- Keep persistent services independent from replaceable screen content.
- Give modal blocking and modal content one explicit owner.
- Treat popup stacks, notifications, tooltips, and reward effects as different transient responsibilities.
- Keep world-linked UI separate from screen-space HUD even when they share visual tokens.
- Repeated list cells, slots, tabs, meters, and buttons should expose data and state inputs rather than reach into global state implicitly.
- Preserve logical navigation order when visual sorting or animation changes.

## Opinionated Guidance

A shallow tree is not automatically better than a deep tree. Prefer boundaries that make lifetime, input, sorting, and reuse obvious. A hierarchy becomes fragile when nodes exist only to compensate for animation, scaling, or masking side effects that are not documented.

## Platform-Specific Guidance

Map these roles to the target engine without copying the hierarchy literally. See [Unity UI Architecture](unity/architecture.md) for Unity Scene, Canvas, prefab, and runtime mapping.

## Unsupported Absolutes

- Do not require one root Canvas, widget tree, or scene for every game.
- Do not equate folder nesting with runtime ownership.
- Do not assume a prefab, widget, or component boundary is also a navigation boundary.
- Do not infer input blocking or render order from hierarchy position alone.

## Verification Contract

Trace one screen from creation to teardown. Verify which owner creates it, which layer sorts it, which object blocks input, where focus begins and returns, what survives a screen change, and what happens when a modal or transition is interrupted.
