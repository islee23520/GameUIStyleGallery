# Agent Instructions

This repository is StyleGallery: a governed gallery with Layout, Motion, Design Engineering, Game UI, and Platform Guides domains. Read [StyleGallery Domains](DOMAINS.md) before adding a domain, changing a domain boundary, or adapting an external source.

Before editing generated artifacts, validators, lifecycle state, or ownership policy, read [Governance, Lifecycle, And Docs-As-Code](GOVERNANCE.md).

## Core Rules

- Classify every change by domain before editing.
- Keep domain-local guidance inside its owning path and preserve shared evidence boundaries.
- Do not use one domain to bypass another domain's constraints.
- Treat `consumer-reference/` as shared non-domain schema, provenance, routing, and evidence infrastructure; it owns no profile values, visual defaults, component implementation, or product CSS.
- Keep dependency direction consumer/profile -> Layout. Do not import consumer-reference records, profile data, tokens, or decorative values into `layout/**`, `patterns/**`, `scripts/pattern-data.mjs`, or `CATALOG.md`.
- Include the consumer-reference handoff field in implementation handoffs. Use one normalized repository-relative JSON record or `not_applicable` with a sentence reason.
- Treat `patterns/**`, `recipes/**`, `GUIDE.md`, and `CATALOG.md` as the Layout corpus at their existing paths.
- Treat the Layout domain as a layout pattern library, not a visual design system.
- Start with semantic HTML before adding layout classes.
- Keep DOM order, reading order, and focus order logical.
- Keep each pattern focused on one primary spatial problem.
- Allow secondary spatial behavior only when it is required for composition.
- Use the smallest robust set of CSS declarations, not the fewest fragile declarations.
- Prefer plain HTML and CSS as the source of truth.
- Make constraints explicit: widths, heights, gaps, breakpoints, scroll containers, and fixed or sticky anchors should be easy to find.
- Make scroll responsibility obvious in both class names and CSS.
- Keep decorative styling out of reusable pattern CSS.

The remaining pattern, CSS, naming, token, checklist, and verification rules apply to the Layout domain. Motion, Design Engineering, Game UI, and Platform Guides documents may discuss product-layer behavior, but they do not authorize decorative or motion properties in reusable Layout pattern CSS.

## Pattern Boundary Gate

Before adding a new pattern or changing reusable pattern CSS, check [Layout Decision Tree](guides/decision-tree.md) and [Layout Brief Template](guides/layout-brief.md).

- Decide whether the work is a new pattern, a recipe composition, or product styling outside this repository.
- Name the layout owner, scroll owner, core layout declarations, excluded demo/product styling, and likely breaking content case.
- For scroll or responsive changes, include the failure case the pattern prevents, such as a missing shrink constraint or a viewport breakpoint used for component-local behavior.
- Add a new pattern only when existing patterns or recipes do not already cover the spatial responsibility.

## CSS Authoring

- Use layout properties only unless a non-layout property is required to explain layout behavior.
- Prefer low-specificity, single-class selectors.
- Do not use ID selectors for styling or layout naming.
- Avoid deep combinators, selector chaining, element-qualified classes, and nesting unless the pattern explicitly demonstrates that tradeoff.
- Use cascade layers when the CSS surface grows beyond isolated snippets.
- Keep CSS declarations in alphabetical order inside each rule.
- Prefer intrinsic sizing and content/container-driven adaptation.
- Use viewport breakpoints only for viewport-level patterns.
- Prefer container queries for component-local responsiveness.
- Prefer logical properties for spacing and sizing unless physical direction is required.
- Use state hooks or `data-*` attributes for variants instead of escalating selector specificity.

## CSS Scope

Allowed by default:

- `align-*`
- `aspect-ratio`
- `block-size`
- `box-sizing`
- `container-*`
- `display`
- `flex-*`
- `gap`
- `grid-*`
- `height`
- `inline-size`
- `inset`
- `justify-*`
- `margin`
- `margin-block`
- `margin-inline`
- `max-*`
- `min-*`
- `overflow`
- `padding`
- `padding-block`
- `padding-inline`
- `place-*`
- `position`
- `width`
- `z-index`

Avoid in reusable pattern CSS unless there is a layout-specific reason:

- `animation`
- `background`
- `border`
- `border-radius`
- `box-shadow`
- `color`
- `filter`
- `font-*`
- `opacity`
- `text-*`
- `transition`
- `transform`

## Class Naming

- Class names must describe layout responsibility, not visual appearance.
- Class names should make relationships obvious: root-child, parent-child, area-element, and fixed-scroll relationships.
- Prefer pattern-scoped names for related nodes.
- Avoid vague names like `container`, `wrapper`, `box`, `top`, `content`, and `bottom` unless the surrounding pattern name makes their responsibility unambiguous.
- Avoid DOM-depth names that mirror every nested node; name stable roles instead.
- Do not use IDs for layout naming. Use IDs only for JavaScript hooks or document-level targets when needed.

Example:

```html
<div class="fixed_header_layout">
    <header class="fixed_header_layout_header"></header>
    <main class="fixed_header_layout_scroll_area"></main>
</div>
```

## Value And Token Policy

- Tokenize reusable design intent, not every layout number.
- Use tokens for stable shared values such as content width, gutters, stack gaps, section gaps, and density steps.
- Keep browser/context mechanics in raw CSS: `auto`, percentages, intrinsic sizing, viewport units, and container-query units.
- Put tokens behind logical CSS, for example `padding-block: var(--space-4)`.
- Use breakpoint names for layout states, not device names.

## Pattern Checklist

Before finishing a pattern change, check:

- Does the pattern optimize one primary spatial problem?
- Can the DOM structure be understood without the CSS?
- Are semantic HTML elements used before layout classes?
- Are class names semantically clear and relationship-aware?
- Is every CSS declaration necessary for robust behavior?
- Are declarations alphabetized?
- Is selector specificity low and intentional?
- Is scroll ownership explicit?
- Are constraints and change points easy to find?
- Did decorative styling stay out of the reusable pattern?

## Verification Checklist

Verify the smallest relevant matrix for the change:

- Viewports: `320px`, `375px`, `768px`, `1024px`, `1440px`
- Containers: tight, medium, roomy, and `100%` parent
- Content: empty, short, long label, long paragraph, unbroken string
- Direction: `ltr` and `rtl`
- Writing mode: default, plus vertical writing mode if the pattern claims support
- Interaction: default, hover, focus, active, expanded, scroll top/middle/bottom when relevant

If there is no runnable gallery surface yet, inspect the snippets directly and report that manual browser verification is not available.
